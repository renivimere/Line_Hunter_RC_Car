Welcome to the Line Hunter RC Car repository! This project won the second prize in [Best Project 2022](https://www.facebook.com/SVNCKH/posts/pfbid0Uuy1woEMcL14PC1rqZJBuTTTeD23EYn6Ysoqj1ujXf7Ttktwe6rjYdV92bN4aaHKl) competition. 

## Overview

The Line Hunter RC Car is a robotic car designed for line-following tasks. 
It achieved the fastest speed among all competitors in the competition, narrowly missing the first place in the finals due to a slight delay in the line detection algorithm.

## Features

- **Line Following:** The RC car is capable of autonomously following lines on the ground.
- **Optimized Firmware:** Utilizes the [8-bit AVR ATmega328p](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega328p) for control and processing tasks. The firmware has been optimized for this simple, cost-effective microcontroller to perform complex control algorithms.
- **Custom Design:** Designed and built from scratch to meet the requirements of line-following applications, using standard RC car components such as motors, wheels, encoders, and line sensors.
- **Maximized Efficiency:** Achieved maximum speed while optimizing power consumption for a 9V battery source.

## Note: 
Due to security concerns related to the competition, the original firmware and assembly schematic of the system are not publicly available. Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
